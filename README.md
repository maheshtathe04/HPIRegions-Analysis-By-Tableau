Problem Statements
 Create a viz (bar chart) which shows the Year(Date) (going across) by SUM(Sales Volume) (going up). Drag "Region Name" to the Color mark. Rename this as "Viz 1".

1. Create a second viz which has:
    "Region Name" on the Rows, and
    Sum(Sales Volume) in the Text marks.
    Rename this as "Viz 2".

2. Create a third viz which has:
    Year(Date) on the Rows shelf
    Sum(Sales Volume) in the Text marks.
    Rename this as "Viz 3".

3. Create a dashboard which has:
    "Viz 2" in the top-left hand corner.
    "Viz 3" in the top-right hand corner.
    "Viz 1" in the bottom half.
    Before you do it, have a think about what is the best order to add the Vizzes into the dashboard.

4. Click on the "Use as Filter" on Viz 2, and click on "East Midlands" in Viz 2. See what happens.

5. Now change this filter so that it only works on a menu.

6. Add a similar filter on Viz 3.

7. Set up this dashboard on a Tablet and a Phone.

8. Create a story, using this dashboard three times. In each story point, select a different region in "Viz 2".
9. Create a new viz. Add the Latitude, Longitude and Population. Look at the results.
10. Show the results by State.
11. How many states are missing? Correct the problem.
12. Zoom into New York so that it roughly fits the screen
13. Create a new viz, with State on the Rows shelf and Sum(Population) as a Text mark.
14. Create a new group, grouping together all states which start with the letter M.
15. Order the viz by Sum of Population descending.
16. Create a new set of "State (group)", containing the top 5 state groups based on Population.
17. Go back to the map viz (or create a fresh map), and change the color scheme to the newly created set.
What is the range of the field SalesVolume? Create a histogram to find out.
18. Change the "SalesVolume (bin)" so that there is a bar every 500.
19. Create a heat map, with "Year(Date)" on the Rows shelf "Quarter(Date)" on the Columns shelf  "SUM(SalesVolume)" as the color and label marks.
20. Change it to a tree map, and remove the "Quarter(Date)" field.
21. Create a new viz, with"Year(Date)" on the Columns shelf, and"SUM(SalesVolume)" and "Avg(AveragePrice)" on the Rows shelf.
Put them on the same graph, using the same synchronized scale.
22. Create a new scatter graph viz, with Avg(AveragePrice) on the Columns shelf, Sum(SalesVolume) on the Rows shelf, and Month(Date) in the Detail.
23. Now add Year(Date) to the Pages shelf. Create a motion graph, showing the History for all marks, and using Both Trails and Marks.
24. Create a dashboard, using the vizzes that you have just created.

SOLUTION ARHCITECTURE

1. I have created a story using dashboard three times
2. I have showed the results by state
3. I have zoom New York 
4. I have created top five state group
5 I have done scatter graph plot
